                    This project is about how you need to guess a word and you get certain amount of trieds to guess each letter to create the
                    word and soon once you see what word it is then you can try and guess what the word is in order to win
                    the round. I created this project on my own using html, CSS, and JavaScript. I use the bootstrap website
                    to help me to create this project and I use github to create the repository that I used to download all
                    of the work I've done. I used CSS to style the website so that the page can look size and clean not a
                    really bad mess on the page.

                    the github repository. This project basically was trying to test you to see how well you know CSS and
                    html and how to use the website bootstrap. This project basically took me about 1 week to finish from
                    beginning to the end.

                    This project was a fun a project because it test how will you know about math, history, english, and music. This project
                    puts you to the test to answer some of the questions really well with the knowledge that you learn through
                    the years. I use JavaScript to make project function so that the game play through. I used html to create
                    the format of the webpage so that you can understand exactly what the webpage is. I use CSS to style
                    the webpage to make nice and clean not a mess. I use different websites to create this game from scratch
                    and they are: One is Bootstrap and this help use different things to make the website even better than
                    before. I use github to create the repository for my porject.

                    This project is a website that basically talks about the different types of matchs you can have in magic the gathering. It
                    also talks about how you can build different decks that you can use against an opponent. When you play
                    a game you start with certain amount of life depending on which game you play. I use a lot in this website
                    because it was my personal website. This website is also about different types of cards you can have
                    in your collection and you can use them in your deck to face off against your opponent.

                    The game is basically about how you can collect crystals so that you can get more powerful than ever. This project took about
                    2 weeks to completed because I had to do some other stuff first before this project. This project had
                    html, CSS, and JavaScript that made the project function. I had some help with this project because it
                    was really touch to create base on what we learn and how to apply everything I learned so far. I made
                    this project on my own and I had some help along the way when I create this project from scratch.

                    The mongooese game took about two weeks to complete from nothing and it had to do with mostly javascript and the server that
                    you create from scratch. I think that this project was a good project because you basically learn as
                    you create the project from scratch. Mongooese also has handlebars that play a key role in the webpage
                    if you don't have handlebars in your webpage then the page will not function.

                    eight listens of the class. The project took about 2 to 4 weeks to complete. My portion of the project
                    was to create the format of the website so that the other team mates can fill in the rest. The other
                    team mates worked on the style and the function of the website. The teacher would give us the wholoe
                    class period to work on the projects so that we can be ready to present the projects in front of the
                    class. When it came to presenting we need to dress really nicely so that we don't lose any points on
                    this group project.

                    can put the other parts to the project. This project was to test how quickly you can get the project
                    finish if you had less time than other projects. When it came to present the projects ours was not finish
                    because we didn't get enough time to finish the project. The teacher and the helpers were counting up
                    the points to see which team did the best then the teacher can tell which teams got first, second and
                    third and each team will win the prize.

                    This project was another group project that we had to work together to complete it. The teacher gave us the rest of the month
                    of july to finish the project and complete any homework assignments or else you don't pass. This project
                    is about an aquarium of fish so that people can look at cool fish from different oceans around the planet.
                    My part was to create the format and get the picture of the fish so that they can put the rest of the
                    project together. The teacher did not calulate the points this time because we were getting ready to
                    present these projects in front of perfessionals. While we were work on the project we can together as
                    acertain location so that week can talk about how much we have done and how much we need to do before
                    the due date. If we need help with the projects we can ask the teacher to help us or one of the helpers
                    that were sitting in the class room. Before we started the project we had to decide what type of project
                    we were going to make as a team. We usually get about a couple of days to brainstorm ideas of what type
                    of project we were going to make. After the couple of days of brainstorm then we had to create rough
                    draft of what the project will look like when it is finish at the end of the six month period.

                    to completed so that any friend can use it just in case of emergency. I did this assignment as homework
                    because at the end of each class we always get homework that we have to complete in one week. If you
                    don't complete this assignment in one week then you will lose a lot of points on the assignment.

                    project took me about two weeks to completed because there was a lot of steps involved in this project.
                    I worked really hard on this project so that I have it completed before the end of the 6-month period.
