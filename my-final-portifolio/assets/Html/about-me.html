        Hi my name is Serge Hattasch and I am going to become a programmmer. I took a cousre that was about six months long and I
        learn a lot in the course over the six months I was there. I leaned about different languages throughout the course.
        One, html this is bascily a languauge that allows you to create a page from scratch and sometimes you need to apply
        some css to make the page the way you want to look like. Two, CSS this is basicly a langauge that you can use to
        style your webpage anyway you like. Third, JavaScript this is the biggest langauge because JavaScript can make your
        webpage function. There are other languages that i learned throughout the course. Some of the langauges were easy
        to learn while others were very tough to learned because of how much harder the course got through the 6-month period.
        I believe the teacher did really well in teaching the course because the other teacher I had before the new teacher
        was tough to deal with and from what I learned from a class mate he told me if the other teacher was still teaching
        most of the class would have quit the class and never came back. Html basically has this main format that I use every
        time I create a webpage. One, is head and this is basiclly where you put your title and the links that you need to
        make the page. Inside the head there is three different things that you will need. One, is title that is something
        that will indicate what your website is. Two, link this is where you need to add links so that the website can apply
        to the links. Third, script this is basiclly something that you will need to connect to the JavaScript file. Two
        body this is the big one and its purpose is to make the webpage the way you want the page to look like. The CSS is
        the style langauge and this basiclly has different steps to make your webpage even better than before. JavaScript
        is the most toughest language to learn becuase it has a lot of different things that can make the webpage work. The
        first one that the JavaScript has is a variable and that is something that defines an object. The second one is an
        array and that is a list of different items you want to list. The Third one is the for loop and that is the quicker
        way to express what each item does in the array. The fourth one is if/else statments those can give two different
        options and you can choose either option. There are other langauges that I learned throughout the course and they
        are as follows: one is jquery which is basiclly similar ti JavaScript. two is react.js. three is mongoose-mongo.
        four is mysql which is a database that you create online. five is handlebars. six is node.js this is basiclly soemthing
        that allows you to run a program. Also when ever you learn mysql you will have to create a server for the database
        that you create online from scratch. sometimes server can have different packages that you can use to help with the
        webpage. There are two different websites you can use to create the webpage. One is bootstrap and that website is
        basicly a site that has different ways you can make the webpage from scratch. Two is materialize and this website
        is similar to bootstrap but has more than the other website. Another website you can use is github and that is a
        site that can save all of the websites you created from scratch it can even allow you to make as many titles of the
        projects as you can. Git Bash is a terimel that allows you to run your website that you created online. Over the
        past 2 to 3 years I made a lot of projects using the knowledge that learned from the class that I took and from the
        help of Jason Summers. Some of the projects took longer than others because of how much I learned from the beginning
        of the class to the end. The first three projects I did were very simple to make because I learned only about html
        and css from the first couple of weeks of class. Then a few weeks later the projects started to get tougher as the
        class moved on throughout the six months. There was also three group projects that i particapted in. Each project
        that we are assign usually will take as many days it will need to finish. I was born in russia and I was living in
        an Orphanage where the peopel treated every so poorly that I could not take it any longer. One day there were two
        parents that adopted me from russia and they took me back to United States of America where I had a good life when
        I was 6 years old. Throughout the years my parest rasied me and now I am all grown up to a man where I am trying
        to get my main job as a programmer. My first job that I recvived was a cashier at McDonalds and soon threw out the
        tiem I've been there A lot of things happened. One day my boss Fresh can up to me and promoted me to a shift manager
        I was so excited. Overall I had a good life and I think that my life can get even better than before from the beginning.
